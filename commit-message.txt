fix: preserve PGN headers and initial FEN when opening saved games

- Fix createLocalGameHeaders to use initialFen instead of final fen
- Preserve complete PGN headers when opening games from dashboard
- Prevent header overwrite that caused incorrect FEN and missing moves

Previously, when opening a saved game from the dashboard, the headers
from createLocalGameHeaders were overwriting the complete PGN headers,
causing:
- Final FEN to be used instead of initial FEN
- Incomplete move sequences to be displayed
- Headers to be replaced with default values
